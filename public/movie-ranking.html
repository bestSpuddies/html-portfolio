<h1>Movies I watched and what I think of them.</h1>
<h2>Top 3</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Very well made, emotional and eye opening.</p>

<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>Super uncomfortable, playing with colors, sound and atmosphere more than any stupid jump scares.</p>

<h3>Haute Tension</h3>
<p>Scarred me for life.</p>
